## Reading on $N_E$

Charlesworth, B. Effective population size and patterns of molecular evolution and variation. *Nat Rev Genet* **10**, 195--205 (2009). <https://doi.org/10.1038/nrg2526> [@charlesworth2009]

## Genetic drift

"The process of evolutionary change involving the random sampling of genes from the parental generation to produce the offspring generation, causing the composition of the offspring and parental generations to differ."

## Exercise

Assuming everyone is here, there are 20 students. Everyone pick an integer at random from 1-20 and write it down. Let's write them on the board.

-   Did we each number only once?

## Offspring count

Imagine a large population. I pick an individual at random to reproduce, then put it back. Then I pick at random again: perhaps the same one, maybe a different one. I stop when I have the same number of offspring as in the initial population. What are the number of offspring each parent could have?

```{r}
hist(rpois(n=10000, lambda=1), breaks=seq(from=-0.5, by=1, to=9.5))
```

## Common $N_E$

-   Why do they differ so much?

-   Why might this matter?

## Causes of different $N_E$

## Equation 1

## Coalescent processes

Using `learnPopGen` [@learnPopGen] to simulate a coalescent process:

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
library(learnPopGen)
par(mfcol=c(1,4))
for (i in sequence(4)) {
	learnPopGen::coalescent.plot(n=5*i) 
}
```

## Q plots

## Selection

```{r, echo=TRUE}

Ne=500
p0=1/Ne
s=0.05
par(mfcol=c(1,1))
learnPopGen::drift.selection(w=c(1+s, 1, 1-s), Ne=Ne, p0=p0, nrep=50)
```

## Q from the paper

```{r, echo=TRUE}
Q_estimate <- function(Ne, s) {
	# Let N = Ne
	N <- Ne
	Q <- (Ne * s / N ) / (1 - exp(-2*Ne*s))
	return(Q)
}
```

## Now try a bunch of values

```{r, echo=TRUE}
s <- seq(from=-0.1, to=0.1, length.out=500)
Ne <- c(1e1, 25, 50, 1e2, 500)
results <- data.frame()
for (s_value in s) {
	for (Ne_value in Ne) {
		Q <- Q_estimate(Ne_value, s_value)
		results <- rbind(results, data.frame(Ne=Ne_value, s=s_value, Q=Q, lambda=Q*2*Ne_value ))		
	}
}
```

## Fixation probabilities

First, in terms of lambda (fixation probability as a multiple of the fixation probability of a neutral allele)

```{r, echo=TRUE}
results$Ne <- as.factor(results$Ne)
results_truncated <- subset(results, abs(results$s)<= 0.01)
ggplot(results_truncated, aes(x=s, y=lambda, group=Ne)) + geom_line(aes(color=Ne)) 
```

## Q plots

Plots of Q, the fixation probability. Note that this is for a wider variety of selection values than above.

```{r, echo=TRUE}
ggplot(results, aes(x=s, y=Q, group=Ne)) + geom_line(aes(color=Ne))
```

## Questions

-   What is "putatively neutral"?

-   "Mode of inheritance effects"?

-   Can $N_E$ be bigger than census size?

-   "Wright-Fisher" describes very few populations. Why do we care about it, then?

-   Fast timescale approximation? Why? When?

-   What effect does extinction of demes in metapopulation have on drift?

## Questions

-   What is a deterministic force?

-   Mutation rate and pop size: how do they relate?

-   How does $N_E$ affect conservation?

-   Where do the equations come from?

-   Why use just one locus for spatial structure?

-   What is pi? Is it the circle thing? Dolly Parton's favorite dessert?
